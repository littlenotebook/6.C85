        <p>Insights about the data/visualization:</p>

        <p>
          To read the graph, I first had to understand the legend at the top
          left. The text states that just the line represents 0 cases, and the
          red area represents 150k new Covid-19 cases in the United States. The
          graph has the spiral and twelve dashed lines. Annotations tell me that
          the dashed lines correspond to the months, where January is the
          vertical line and the months increase clockwise. The spiral begins in
          January, having an annotation for the year 2020, so I infer that this
          dataset starts from January 2020. As the spiral moves outwards, the
          red area increases, indicating that cases of Covid-19 are increasing.
          The fattest part of the spiral occurs around November 2020 to March
          2021 and then thins. Then the red area begins to increase again around
          August 2021 to October 2021, staying consistent until a huge increase
          in Jan 2022, where the spiral ends. The end of the spiral likely means
          that this article was published soon after, so there was no additional
          data yet.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I see a trend where Covid-19 cases increase in the later half of the
            year, likely because the weather becomes colder resulting in more
            indoor gatherings. Moreover, seasonal sickness like the flu can
            weaken immune systems, causing more people to get sick easier.
          </li>
          <li>
            The consistently thicker red area after July 2021 suggests a
            sustained period of time where a lot of people were getting Covid-19
            every week, this might result from loosened regulations and weaker
            Covid-19 prevention measures as people believed that the risk was
            over.
          </li>
          <li>
            This graph visualizes that Covid-19 spread very quickly, as I
            observe that the red area from October 2020 to November 2020 almost
            tripled in size. Moreover, the thickness of the spiral didn't vary
            much from start of the month to end of the month, suggesting that
            the people who got sick likely spread it to at least one other
            person very soon.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Design Critique:</p>

        <p>
          The shape of the spiral isn't very conventional in temporal
          visualizations and adds some cofusion to any reader trying to
          understand the visualization. However, the spiral shape does condense
          a lot of information very concisely, into a small space, compared to a
          line graph that would be very horiziontally long over three years of
          data. The annotations are nicely placed, especially the years and the
          arrows pointing to the direction the reader's eye should look. These
          annotions are very necessary because we conventionally read up to
          down, left to right, and not around in circles. One question I had
          while first looking at the graph was if we could tell what day or week
          this data was for by looking at the spacing on the dotted lines, but
          this was not part of the design. I do understand the inspiration
          between the spiral, which probably is a clock. Since clocks are also
          structured with time increasing clockwise, it's reasonable that the
          author would design a temporal visualization this way.<br />
          Using the area around the spiral to represent a numerical value isn't
          a very effective visual encoding, as it's difficult for the audience
          to compare irregularly shaped areas. However, it helps that the area
          is outlined in a solid, dark red color, so the reader can look at the
          ups and downs of the line instead. The spiral shape also makes
          comparing the trends across the entire graph difficult, because the
          data is at different angles. For me, comparing month to month was
          easier than comparing year to year. While the legend is helpful to
          understand what the red area around the line means, the 150k value
          doesn't provide much 'context' to the reader. Personally, when I saw
          the number 150k, I thought,
          <em>Oh that's a big number</em>, but as I was reading the graph, the
          number never came to mind. I don't think this graph effectively
          communicates the scale of the data to the reader.

        <h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/A3(1).jpeg" alt="" />
          <figcaption>
            Line graph of New Covid-19 cases, United States over time (2020,
            20221, Jan 2022)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted to change the spiral shape to a visualization type that
            would be easier to read, therefore I chose the classic line graph.
            To help visualize the change in new covid-19 cases over time, I set
            the months on the x-axis and the number of cases on the y-axis. I
            set the range to 0 to 500k, which I estimated was a suitable range
            based on the graph. I also split the y-axis into 5 intervals, which
            allows the reader to more accurately read the numbers. I also
            annoted which months belonged to 2020, 2021, and 2022.
          </li>
          <li>
            I decided to but the dates on top, because that's how we usually
            read calenders. I believe putting the x-axis on top also makes the
            graph more spacious.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted to make the trends month to month more distinguished so I
            added gray dotted lines separating each month. In this way, one
            could see both the yearly and monthly trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            I kept the red color because red is eye-catching, and carries a more
            serious connotation than soft pink or greens.
          </li>
          <li>
            This visualization creates a very wide output image, which might be
            hard to display on small screens or paper. To better fit it on a
            screen, it would be possible to add a horizontal sliding/scrolling
            function.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/A3(2).jpeg" alt="" />
          <figcaption>

            month, USA for 2020, 2021, and Jan 2022, separated by orange, green,
            and blue colors.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Instead of repeating the months in the first graph, I chose to just
            display January through December once on the x-axis. This time I put
            the x-axis on the bottom, because we are used to reading scatter
            plots from down to up. It makes sense to have the reader first read
            the month, and then read the data points that correspond to that
            month.
          </li>
          <li>
            Different from sketch 1, I labeled the y-axis as
            <em>average</em> number of new Covid-19 cases <em>per month</em>.
            This is because a scatter plot can't show the distribution over the
            month like the line graph can, so I found another metric. I felt
            that finding the average wouldn't be misleading, because from what I
            observe from the original graph, there is small variation from start
            to end of each month.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to differentiate between the years, I used different
            colors. These colors are pretty distinguishable, and none of them
            are too bright.
          </li>
          <li>
            This graph is more compact than the line graph, and it also allows
            the reader to easily compare trends for one month across different
            years. However, it doesn't show the trends within each month, so
            it's not as effective for showing how quickly Covid-19 spread.
          </li>
        </ul>

            Covid cases per month, and solid lines for average number of new
            Covid cases in that month in the United States. Red lines and areas
            show the development of new Covid cases over time. The data spans
            Jan 2020 to Dec 2021.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I aimed to integrate both the continuous trends per month and the
            average number of new cases for comparison between 2020 and 2021. So
            I thought of using a comparison chart that uses line marks, because
            we are good at comparing lengths visually. As there are only two
            averages I can estimate from the original graph: total new cases
            over the year / 12, and average number of cases over a certain
            month, I only needed 2 line marks. Since the first is consistent for
            each month throughout the year, I decided to use a dashed mark to
            represent it, so it wouldn't overpower the later. The second average
            is more specific to each month, so I used a solid line to represent
            it. In this design choice, I chose to highlight the trends between
            months more than the trends between years.
          </li>
          <li>
            I put the data for 2020 on the left, the names of the months in the
            middle because both years share the same months, and the data for
            2021 on the left. I felt this was pretty readible and concise.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted to keep the red areas from the original graph because they
            show how fast Covid-19 spread. To do this, I copied the shape of the
            red line/area and kept only the half above the line. I think having
            areas both above and below the line would get confusing and crowded,
            so I only kept the top half. Because each monthly interval is the
            same size, the red areas can no longer correspond to the actual
            number of cases, so they only show the trend. I think this retains
            the most important takeaway even without conveying the exact
            numbers, and even the original graph didn't really convey the exact
            numbers. Instead of making the reader guess, this design choice gets
            rid of area estimating and just shows the visual trend.
          </li>
          <li>
            The legend explains what the lines mean, but I couldn't think of a
            way to explain the red areas. Since the red areas don't represent
            numbers anymore, I felt that maybe it was okay to not include it in
            the legend. Possibly some sort of annotion or text would help
            explain what the red area represents. X0k and X00k labels stand for
            the actual values, but I didn't calcualte them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added the gray striped background to help the reader distinguish
            between consecutive months.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Writeup</h2>

        <p>
          I chose to build off of the line and area graph in sketch 1 for my
          final design. Unlike the data from the original NYTimes graph, this
          dataset includes the entire year of 2022. Therefore the tornado plot
          (sketch 3) wouldn't work anymore. Finally, I like the line graph more
          than the scatterplot, because it shows the trends within each month.
          <br />
          The aim of my visualization is to show the virulence of Covid-19, both
          how quickly the virus spread and how fatal it was. I chose the two
          measures to best represent this: New Confirmed and New Deceased. To
          show Covid-19's transmissiblity, I used a line graph to depict how New
          Confirmed cases changed from month to month. Condensing the data to be
          just year to year wasn't enough to show the nauances of the trends,
          and expanding the data to week to week elongated the graph until the
          trends were also hard to visualize. I added additional grid lines
          between the month in order to provide the readers an opportunity to
          clearly observe the trends within a month too if they wished. I also
          think additional grid lines help the reader compare and contrast the
          degree of increase or decrease better than without them. <br />
          Because the reader's eyes would likely focus on the biggest peak at
          Jan 2022, making the other years seem less important as a result and
          making it hard to visualizae the trends for all three years equally.
          To combat this bias, I added the log trend line of New Confirmed for
          each year. I chose log over linear because log could better summarize
          the up and downs across the years. I used a dashed a lighter gray line
          so it doesn't overpower the main line graph. <br />
          In order to show how fatal Covid-19 was, I also felt that adding New
          Deceased would help bolster my argument that Covid-19 was a dangerous
          virus. Because I didn't want to crowd the space with multiple lines,
          and I feel that newly confirmed cases were interconnected with newly
          deceased cases as spread of the virus causes more people to be at risk
          of dying, I decided to represent New Deceased without a separate line.
          Instead, I used the thickness and color hue of the New Confirmed line.
          I believe that using both thickness and color hue instead of only one
          element helped bring more visual emphasis on the New Deceased data. As
          the hue becomes more intense when the value of New Deceased gets big,
          this also helps to lead the reader's eyes to the areas of the graph
          where we see the biggest harm of Covid-19. Since neither axes show the
          scale of the New Deceased data, the legend on the right is important
          to understand what value different line thicknesess represent. <br />
          I also decided to add annotations to the data points at the two peaks.
          This helps the reader understand the scale of the data by seeing exact
          numbers, and it also might aid the reader in understanding how to read
          the graph. I considered that adding the values of New Deceased in the
          annotations might be confusing if someone misses the legend, since the
          numbers seem quite random and not on the same scale as the number of
          New Confirmed. However, I included it in the annotation anyway because
          having both New Confirmed and New Deceased values describes the data
          point as a whole. Hiding or not including information might affect
          this visualization's reliability or trust in the reader's perspective.
          <br />
          For further steps, I would've like to add some other line or visual
          element to provide more context to put into perspective how many
          people died from Covid-19. Data visualizations often take out the
          emotional aspect, but the Covid-19 pandemic affected a lot of people
          and families, I think more could be done to create emotion, empathy,
          and maybe even regret that this pandemic had multiple devastating
          periods because of weakening regulations too soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I state in my original critique, I think my line graph
          visualization is more easily understandable to the reader, because
          people are used to reading chronologically from left to right, not in
          a spiral order. I also improved on the lack of precisness of the area
          under a line by adding annotions and multiple intervals on the y-axis.
          The way I added new data (New Deceased) by varying thickness of the
          line might cause exact valuesof New Confirmed being harder to read.
          Another critique that I want to add of the original NYTimes graph is
          that as I was trying to make sense of the trends, I was always trying
          to remember which months are between the four labeled months. So
          instead of making the reader ponder about which month comes before
          April, I labeled every month on the x-axis. As a result, my graph does
          take up more space and looks repetitive, but allows the reader to
          focus more on the trends of the line. However, the spiral graph is
          visually interesting and creative, while a line graph is pretty common
          and not unique.
