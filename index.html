    <h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>
    <h3>Dataset</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>housing_sf_other_w_census_metadata</code> dataset contains
      measures related to single family housing in each municipality across
      Greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The information includes spatial data
      and associated numerical data for single-family and other types of housing
      in zoning districts of the 101 municipalities. This dataset is aggregated
      data provided by MPAC, American Community Survey, US Census: Decennial
      Census, and the Massachusetts government. The second dataset contains
      geographical data about municipal boundaries across Greater Boston. This
      dataset is provided by MassGIS. I'm interested in these two datasets
      because together they include both spatial and tabular data. As a whole,
      it is a large dataset with lots of subcategories to study patterns of
      housing and zoning that exists in Greater Boston.

    <h3>Analysis Questions</h3>
    <p>
      <b
        >1. In what parts of Greater Boston do most family and non family
        households live?</b
      ><br />
      &emsp; I'm curious about the distribution of family and non family
      households across Greater Boston. I expect to see that most family
      households prefer suburban areas (as someone who grew up in a suburban
      town), while nonfamily households prefer cities because of their vibrant
      communities.<br />
      <b>2. Do cities have more housing opportunity than suburban areas?</b
      ><br />
      &emsp; Cities are often assumed to have more housing opportunity because
      of their higher population density, but as someone who grew up in a
      suburban area, I wonder if that truly is the case. <br />
      <b
        >3. Do areas with more elderly have lower proportion of single family
        households?</b
      >
      <br />
      &emsp; I thought of this question after reading the line "baby boomers
      looking to downsize" in the article "Living Little" by MPAC. I think a lot
      of articles I've read so far focus on how hard it is to buy a home for
      younger people starting out their adult life, so this was another
      perspective to think about. If the baby boomer generation is inclined to
      leave zones with a lot of single family housing, then I would expect a
      lower proportion of single family households in areas with more elderly
      residents. This result would matter because it would show both young and
      old are have a need for more affordable middle housing, which should
      require more attention and action.
    </p>

    <h3>Discovery and Insights</h3>

    <p>
      First, to evaluate the quality of the dataset. I constructed a scatter
      plot of municipal population versus the percentage of land zoned
      exclusively for single-family housing. I chose a scatter plot because
      there are over 100 municipalities, which would not fit on either the x
      axis or the y axis. Therefore, it would save a lot of space to have
      municipalities as the dots in the plot. I expect to see a negative
      correclation, as the bigger the population, the less space of single
      family housing in that munipality.<br />

      <img src="images/A2(1).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      Two data quality concerns emerge immediately. First, a lot of
      municipalities display values exceeding 100% for the percentage of land
      zoned for single-family housing. Given the stated definition of this
      variable (single-family land area divided by total land are for housing)
      values above 100% are logically impossible. This suggests that the
      percentage may have been computed using an incorrect denominator,
      potentially one that excludes the single-family land component. Because
      the underlying land-area variables are not available in the dataset, I
      can't recompute or correct this measure directly. <br />
      Second, a large portion of municipalities report 0% single-family zoning.
      While this is theoretically possible, such high frequency of such
      observations in suburban areas raises concern about misclassification or
      reporting inconsistencies. Without additional documentation or access to
      the raw zoning data, it is not possible to determine definitively whether
      these values reflect true zoning patterns or data limitations. <br />
      One outlier that catches my eye is the point at (0, 0), which is
      Burlington. There are obviously people living in Burlington, so there is
      an obvious error in the data collection. <br />
      While the percentage of land zoned for single-family housing was intended
      to serve as a potential explanatory factor in residential patterns, the
      inconsistencies observed in this variable limit its reliability for causal
      interpretation. As a result, I would be cautious about my conclusions
      drawn from using this dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      To address the first question of which parts of Greater Boston contain the
      largest numbers of family households, I constructed a spatial
      visualization in which circle size is proportional to the number of family
      households in each municipality, overlaid on the regional geography.
      Although we learned from class that humans have a hard time perceiving the
      exact ratio of circle areas, my motive is to give the reader a general
      idea of the distribution, not the exact numerical values. Because the
      dataset includes over 100 municipalities, it would be unreasonable and
      overwhelming for the reader to comrephend over 100 circles on a map, so I
      focused on the top ten communities with the highest counts of family
      households in order to highlight the dominant residential concentrations.
      <br />

      <img src="images/A2(2).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      Major cities are labeled in light gray to provide geographic context. The
      visualization suggests that the municipalities with the largest numbers of
      family households tend to be located outside the densest urban areas
      (aside from Boston and Salem). This pattern helps indicate that families
      prefer less densely populated environments, potentially reflecting
      preferences for quieter neighborhoods, perceived safety, or access to
      larger living spaces. However, the presence of Boston and Salem among the
      top ten suggests that a lot of families choose to reside in urban
      settings, which may be influenced by factors such as proximity to
      employment, cultural amenities, or public transportation. Further analysis
      we can do to better understand which factors are at play in the
      residential choices of families is to look at the distribution of
      household income in these ten areas. <br />
      While I was working with the income data in Tableau, I noticed that the
      categories weren't named in the same way across the dataset. Some incomes
      had the prefix with inc-, some prefixed with i-, or something else, which
      made it hard to order the measures and I needed to reference back and
      forth to the the dataset. Another inconsitency or possibly misleading
      element of the data was that the incomes increased on an interval of 5k
      and then suddenly jumped 25k from 75k to 100k and then another sudden jump
      by 50k from 150k to 200k. This difference can't be seen at first sight and
      if shown using a line graph with constant intervals, the readers would
      easily get misled. Therefore, I didn't choose to use a line graph,
      instead, I chose to use a density graph. Another advantage of using a
      density graph was that visually, the dots are less crowded than if using a
      line graph (10 lines on one graph is overwhelming). However, the trade off
      is that we can't tell what munipality each data points represents.
      Moreover, it's hard to tell exactly how much greater or less than each
      density point is compared to another, because the faint color differences
      are hard to percieve. Overall, using a density plot allows us tosee which
      type of income is more common in the top ten municipalities, without
      needing to know exactly which data point is which municipality. <br />

      <img src="images/A2(3).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      I observe that a large number of people have higher incomes, with the
      highest peak at incomes over 200k and another peak at incomes between 75k
      and 100k. This result aligns with my expectations. As single family homes
      are more expensive, it makes sense that the top ten municipalities with
      the most family households would also have higher incomes. However, I also
      notice that there are still households with lower incomes living in these
      areas as well. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as
      affordable housing options within these municipalities, or families
      prioritizing values that are more important to them than housing cost. It
      would be interesting to further investigate the specific housing options
      available in these municipalities and how they cater to different income
      levels. <br />

      Moving on, let's take a look at the distribution of nonfamily households
      in a similar manner.
      <img src="images/A2(4).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      In contrast to family households, nonfamily households appear to cluster
      more strongly near urban centers, particularly in municipalities closer to
      Boston. This spatial pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that
      nonfamily households may prioritize proximity to employment opportunities,
      public transportation access, and urban amenities including restaurants
      and entertainment venues. <br />

      Similar to the previous case, I'm interested in understanding the income
      distribution of nonfamily households.

      <img src="images/A2(5).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      In this graph, the main peak is at the income range of 75k to 100k, which
      is lower than the highest peak for family households. This result is also
      in line with my expectations, as nonfamily households may include a higher
      proportion of younger individuals, students, or single professionals who
      may have lower incomes compared to family households. <br />

      Another interesting observation I have is that the legends show a
      difference in overall household totals. The range of family households
      (279–487 among the top municipalities) exceeds that of nonfamily
      households (189–431), indicating that family households are more numerous
      overall in the dataset. A comparison of aggregate counts confirms this:
      there are approximately 15,000 family households compared to just over
      6,000 nonfamily households. Despite being fewer in number, nonfamily
      households appear more spatially concentrated, particularly in
      municipalities adjacent to the urban core. One notable case is Salem,
      which shows one of the largest total household counts and a relatively
      balanced distribution between family and nonfamily households. This raises
      the question of what local factors might contribute to this pattern.
      <br />

      It would be impossible to analyze every single factor, but one factor that
      would be interesting to study is age. We can investigate whether
      municipalities with larger elderly populations also have higher
      proportions of land zoned for single-family housing. If this relationship
      exists, it may suggest that areas dominated by single-family housing tend
      to attract or retain older residents, potentially reflecting life-cycle
      housing preferences such as homeownership stability or aging in place. Or
      this relationship is negative, then possible as the "Living Little"
      suggests, the elderly are sizing down and unable to maintain single family
      homes. <br />

      <img src="images/A2(6).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      Municipalities with more single-family housing and older populations may
      also be more likely to contain established family households, while areas
      with fewer single-family zones and younger populations may correspond more
      closely to nonfamily households, including young professionals or
      students. Although this graph is able to show data for each municipality,
      it's not the best format to visualize the relationship between elderly
      population and % single family because the axes are different units and
      ranges. Instead, I decided to sacrifice municipality level clarity in
      exchange for a clearer visualization that could tell us something about
      the correlation we're invesitagting. <br />

      <img src="images/A2(7).png" width="600" class="center-image" />

      Now we can more clearly observe some trends. First, I notice that the
      porportion of elderly population is mostly underneath the line for higher
      percentage (150-200%) of single family housing land. The rightmost peak
      above the line representing high proportion of elderly population and high
      percentage of single family housing is in Milton, which is also included
      in the top 10 municipalities for nonfamily households. This data faintly
      suggests that the elderly population is following the housing trend of
      nonfamily households.<br />

      Second, there's actually not a very defintive trend at all. As we can see
      from the up and down of the graph, there are many municipalities with a
      low percentage of single family housing land and a low proportion of
      elderly population, or the opposite. This result is surprising to me
      because I expected to see a clearer correlation between the two variables.
      This result suggests that age is not a primary factor in determining the
      distribution of housing types in a municipality. <br />

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    In this exploratory data analysis, I explored the spatial distribution of
    family and nonfamily households across Greater Boston municipalities. I
    first checked the data quality and found quite a few points of missing and
    unreliable data. Then, I addressed my analysis questions by investigating
    the distribution of family and nonfamily households. I found that the data
    suggests family households concentrate further from urban cities than
    nonfamily households do. While diving deeper to find a possible reason
    behind this trend, I discovered that the relationship between elderly
    population share and single-family zoning didn't show a strong pattern,
    indicating that age alone can't determine housing form across
    municipalities. <br />

    I learned a lot through the process of assessing the dataset quality. I've
    never done this step before and this assignment allowed me to explore and
    realize how and why this step is important. Another thing I learned as I was
    creating visualizations was understanding how often trade-offs had to be
    made. I discovered that it's difficult to balance clarity and all the data
    I'd like to include in one visualization.
